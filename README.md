# HUMAN-EXERCISE-RECOGNITION-AND-REP-COUNTER
In this project, we explore the use of various machine learning models for the task of human exercise recognition and repetition counting. We utilize both signal data, obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope readings, and video data, processed using pose estimation techniques.
